The user testing of my website went well. The two testers felt as if they could easily use and navigate between pages on my website. However, they both said that they thought I should center the images at the bottom of my homepage and also change the navigation bar on my homepage.
I followed the advice of my testers and centered the homepage images and the navigation bar.
