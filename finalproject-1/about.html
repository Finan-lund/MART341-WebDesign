                    A Word From The Owner
                </h2>
                <p>
                  I have always felt that there is a need for more art and designs on products used in the outdoors. After a few seasons of drawing on my own leather ski mittens, I decided to find a way to make a very warm and quality pair of mittens with some fun designs. Using some basic graphics, I sent my mitten idea to many different manufacturers to create what I had in mind.

  I received a lot of samples that didnâ€™t turn out great, but after a while I was finally able to find a manufacturer that could create a quality pair of mittens. After winning some prize money from an entrepreneurship ideas competition through the University of Montana, I was able to launch the business. I decided on the name Karn, (a variation of the word cairn) meaning a stack of rocks used as a landmark. In the Selkirk Mountains where I spent my youth, many of the trails were marked with cairns so hikers would not lose their way.

  This is only the beginning for Karn, and I have many different products and designs planned for next ski season!
